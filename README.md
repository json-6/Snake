Snake
=====
Open source snake game for Dance Marathon at UF (HTML 5, Javascript, and PHP)). Playable on the web, iOS (iPhone 4/4S), and Android devices (tested on the Moto X).
With a hack it is (somewhat) playable on a DDR mat.

Link: host taken down :( 

Rules: use "asdf" keys, arrow keys, or touch the screen (mobile) to move the congo line. Pick up points by eating hearts, presents, and more.
